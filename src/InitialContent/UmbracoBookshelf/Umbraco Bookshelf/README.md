#Welcome!#
*Version 0.1*

Thanks for downloading Umbraco Bookshelf!  Bookshelf will allow users to create, display and share Umbraco learning resources quickly.

Bookshelf works by reading markdown files from the `UmbracoBookshelf` folder of your website. 

##Install a Book##
Books are available via http://our.umbraco.org in the packages section.  Install like you would any other Umbraco Package.

##Editing a Book##
To edit a book, simply click `Edit` on an `.md` file page.  If the book is hosted on GitHub, please consider sending revisions and additional content.

##Creating a Book#
Books are just `.md` files that live in the `UmbracoBookshelf` folder of your webroot.  So to create a book, just create a sub-folder next to your other books (like this one).  By default when a user clicks the folder in the tree to the left, the `README.md` file is loaded for the user.

Want to add images?  Just add a folder with images and use relative links.

Links beginning with `http` auto open in a new tab.

Books should be written in Markdown and Bookshelf recognizes Github Flavored Markdown.  Please use the following resources when learning Markdown:

* https://help.github.com/articles/markdown-basics/
* https://help.github.com/articles/github-flavored-markdown/

*Please refrain from using `HTML` directly when possible.  Some things like embedding videos are unavoidable.*
